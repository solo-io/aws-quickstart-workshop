## Lab 1 - Deploy Gloo Platform

![Gloo Platform EKS Workshop Architecture](/images/gloo-platform-eks-workshop-lab1.png)

Gloo Platform provides a management plane to interact with the service mesh and gateways in your environment. The management plane exposes a unified API that is multi-tenant and multi-cluster aware. It is responsible for taking your supplied configuration and updating the mesh and gateways in your clusters. Included in the management plane is a UI for policy and traffic observability.

1. Set this env var to the Gloo license key.

    ```sh
    export GLOO_PLATFORM_LICENSE_KEY=<licence_key>
    ```

2. Install meshctl, the Gloo command line tool for bootstrapping Gloo Platform, registering clusters, describing configured resources, and more. Be sure to download version 2.4.4, which uses the latest Gloo Mesh installation values.

    ```sh
    curl -sL https://run.solo.io/meshctl/install | GLOO_MESH_VERSION=v2.4.4 sh -
    export PATH=$HOME/.gloo-mesh/bin:$PATH
    ```

3. Install Gloo Platform. This command uses profiles to install the control plane components, such as the management server and Prometheus server, and the data plane components, such as the agent, managed Istio service mesh, rate limit server, and external auth server, in your cluster.

    ```
    meshctl install --profiles gloo-mesh-single,ratelimit,extauth \
      --set common.cluster=cluster-1 \
      --set demo.manageAddonNamespace=true \
      --set licensing.glooMeshLicenseKey=$GLOO_PLATFORM_LICENSE_KEY
   ```

4. Wait 2-3 minutes for all components to install. Use **meshctl check** to check status.

5. Once everything is ready, view the Gloo Platform Dashboard:

    ```
    meshctl dashboard
    ```

6. As you might notice there is no Workspaces created yet. Lets create **Global Workspace** in the case of this Lab to simplify the deployment lets include all services within the same workspace. This means that they all share the same service discovery policies and security. This is only recommended for this workshop to allow beginners learning Gloo Mesh.

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
    kind: Workspace
    metadata:
      name: global-workspace
      namespace: gloo-mesh
    spec:
      workloadClusters:
      - name: '*'            # all namespaces in all clusters
        namespaces:
        - name: '*'
    ---
    apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
    kind: WorkspaceSettings
    metadata:
      name: global-settings
      namespace: gloo-mesh
    spec:
      exportTo:
      - workspaces:
        - name: global-workspace
        resources:
        - kind: SERVICE
          namespace: gloo-mesh-gateways
    EOF
    ```

7. Wait for the Gloo Gateway Service to become ready and set it's IP address to a variable for us to use later:

    ```sh
    export GLOO_GATEWAY=$(kubectl -n gloo-mesh-gateways get svc istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].*}')
    printf "\n\nGloo Gateway available at https://$GLOO_GATEWAY\n"
    ```

Note: No application will respond to this address...yet!

In this Lab, we have successfully set up the foundational elements of the Gloo Platform. We've installed essential components like the Gloo command line tool, established the Gloo Platform, and created a Global Workspace. This setup paves the way for deploying actual applications and managing their traffic, which will be our focus in the next lab. Remember, the structures we've put in place here are crucial for the seamless operation of more complex service mesh architectures that we will explore.

As we transition to the next Lab, we will leverage this infrastructure to deploy and expose a sample application. This will not only demonstrate the practical application of our setup but also introduce us to the real-world scenarios of managing microservices traffic.
